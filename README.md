## Introduction
Test automation is an essential practice in modern software development, allowing the repeated execution of tests quickly and reliably. The use of frameworks like Selenium, combined with programming languages like Java, facilitates the creation of robust and efficient test scripts.

BDD (Behavior Driven Development) is a methodology that aims to integrate stakeholders in the development process, using a common language to describe the expected behavior of the system. Automated tests are written in a readable format that can be understood by all team members, including business analysts, developers, and testers.


- **Purpose**

  > This automation project aims to demonstrate knowledge in software testing, using Java, Selenium, and the BDD (Behavior Driven Development) framework. The proposal is to create a set of automated tests for a web application, focusing on the validation of asserts (assertions) to ensure the correct functioning of the system.

## Tecnologies

 - $${\color{lightgreen}Selenium:}$$ In essence, Selenium automates web browser interactions to test website functionality, ensuring a smooth user experience.

 - $${\color{green}Cucumber:}$$ The Cucumber dependency is a critical component for behavior-driven development (BDD) in Java projects. It facilitates the execution of feature files, which are human-readable descriptions of software behavior written in Gherkin.
  
- $${\color{red}JavaFaker:}$$ JavaFaker is a popular Java library used to generate realistic test data.
  
- $${\color{blue}Maven:}$$ Maven is a powerful build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies the build process by Managing dependencies, Building and packaging, Project lifecycle and Reporting.
    
- $${\color{white}Java:}$$ Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence, meaning code written on one system can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
    

## How to install and build

- **Requirements**  
  - Java Development Kit (JDK): Install the latest version of the JDK.
  - Build Tool: Maven
  - IDE: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
  - Drivers: Install the drivers corresponding to the browsers that will be used (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
