## Introduction

Docusaurus is a project for building, deploying, and maintaining open source project websites easily.

Short on time? Check out our [5-minute tutorial ⏱️](https://tutorial.docusaurus.io)!

**Tip**: use **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)** to test Docusaurus immediately in a playground.

- **Simple to Start**

> Docusaurus is built in a way so that it can [get running](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation) in as little time as possible. We've built Docusaurus to handle the website build process so you can focus on your project.

- **Localizable**

> Docusaurus ships with [localization support](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/introduction) via CrowdIn. Empower and grow your international community by translating your documentation.

- **Customizable**

> While Docusaurus ships with the key pages and sections you need to get started, including a home page, a docs section, a [blog](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog), and additional support pages, it is also [customizable](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages) as well to ensure you have a site that is [uniquely yours](https://docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout).
